# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I determined which classes to define based on the nouns: Members, Affairs, and Organizations. Once I established those, I knew I needed an AffairManager class to manipulate and connect those 3 classes. (I also knew I needed an AffairManager class based on the ui.ts :P ) Not going to lie, my architecture is pretty garbage. I definately could have made it cleaner/nicer instead of making it so complex. 


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I received help from StackOverflow and TypescriptLang.org. 


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> About 7 hours. I know it would have not taken me this long and my code wouldn't have been so funky if this were written in a "normal" language like C++ or Java. TypeScript/JavaScript is definitely not my forte.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> I would say this was about a 7. The most challenging part of this assignment was going through the ui.ts file and understanding what the functions we were supposed to implement are supposed to do. This was the most time consuming part and it made me get lost so many times and I confused myself quite a bit. The assignment itself wasn't too bad, espcially after getting somewhat of an understanding of what works with each other. It was also a little difficult because this class is my first experience with TypeScript/JavaScript so I definitely had to use my resources to figure out syntaxes and such. Overall, I just kept confusing myself especially since my architecture is pretty bad.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Maybe make the instructions a little bit more clear. Especially the part about searching for members, affairs, or organizations. Also, the ui.ts was pretty confusing for me to read and some parts were difficult to associate with the instructions in the word doc.
